  <h1>RSS</h1>

  <p class="lead">Feeds without fuzz.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-rss">What is RSS?</h2>
<p>Originally, RSS stood for &ldquo;RDF/Rich Site Summary&rdquo; but was later changed to &ldquo;Really Simple Syndication&rdquo;</p>
<p>RSS is a way to subscribe to a website.
Whenever that website updates it writes its changes to a <code>XML</code> file.
You can then read this XML file and see what changed at a glance.</p>
<p>Many websites use RSS including YouTube, <del>Reddit</del> Lemmy, <del>Twitter</del> Mastodon, most news sites, and almost any blog out there.
For many blogs, RSS is the main way to distribute new posts.</p>
<p>RSS is experiencing a Renaissance at the moment:
Many people are now seeing the damages done by algorithmic feeds and want to go back to purely chronological feeds.
RSS provides a perfect infrastructure for this.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-rss">How to read RSS?</h2>
<p>First, you need a feed reader. On macOS and iOS I highly recommend <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>.
For terminal fans <a href="https://newsboat.org">Newsboat</a> is the way to go.
<a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a> is also a good choice but there are tons of programs that can read RSS feeds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bascially it. Now you need to add some feeds and you are ready.</p>
<p>I recommend picking a reader that can also fetch the article without opening the browser and loading a ton of ads.</p>
<p>Pro tip: You can export your subscibtions to a <code>OPML</code> file and import them into any RSS reader.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-distribute-rss">How to distribute RSS?</h2>
<p>This is the hardest question to answer about RSS as there are endless possibilities.</p>
<p>The easiest way would probably be to use a service such as Mastodon that generates the feed automatically.
If that platform isn&rsquo;t for you, WordPress is a good way to host a blog.
I read about people setting up their own scripts that automatically update the feed for new posts.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> which is a <em>static site generator</em>.
It generates feeds automatically but lies somewhere between WordPress and writing your own scripts in terms of how tech savvy you should be.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-rss">How to find RSS?</h2>
<p>Go to a website you like, copy the URL and paste it into your RSS reader.
Modern feed readers can find RSS feed on their own, you just have to provide a link to the site you want to subscribe to.
If that is not the case, you could try adding <code>/index.xml</code> to the URL.</p>
<p>Some sites, like this one, also link to their RSS feeds.
Often those links are a the bottom of the website and are either marked as <code>RSS</code>, <code>Feed</code>, or just use the RSS logo.
I additionally provide links to my subprojects such as my <a href="/micro">microblog</a> or my <a href="/fotos">photos</a>.
Feel free to add them to your reader.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think RSS is on the rise.
It&rsquo;s an old protocol that survived numerous challenges
It provides an escape from the algorithms and large social media companies.
It also provides a way for content creators to distribute their content on their own without any middleman.</p>
